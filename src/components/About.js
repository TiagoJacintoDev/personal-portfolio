          I'm a self-taught front-end developer from Portugal. I enjoy turning
          complex problems into simple and intuitive solutions. Most of my
          projects are done with React.js. A framework that I love because it
          plays to my strengths: Planning and organizing
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Aside from that, I'm also an avid reader. When I'm not coding, you'll
          probably find me reading something on my Kindle or tinkering with my
          computer.
