            I'm a self-taught front-end developer from Portugal. I enjoy turning
            complex problems into simple and intuitive solutions. Most of my
            projects are done with React.js. A framework that I love because it
            plays to my strengths: Planning and Organizing

            Aside from that, I love to do sports. I was a futsal player for 8
            years and currently what I do the most is running.
